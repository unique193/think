<h2>My Top 10 favourites</h2>
<p>In no particular order,<em> my all time top 10</em> are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Homeland</b></li>
<p>I LOVE this show. Why? Because i love the storyline; it keeps me on the edge of my seat and isn't cliched. It's definitely a must watch.</p></p></p>

<li><b>Power</b></li>
<p>James St Patrick is a spice of life. Need i say more? Haha. This show is badass; it took me by surprise.</p>

<li><b>Breaking Bad (obviously)</b></li>
<p>I jumped on the bandwagon with this one. Luckily, there were enough bandwagons to go around. It didn't dissapoint.</p>

<li><b>Prison Break</b></li>
<p>I loved the drama this show provided from the onset. Kudos to the acting too; i hated T-Bag with a passion. The sequel though? I reckon it's a flop</p>

<li><b>Banshee</b></li>
<p>I can say this is the best show that nobody knows about. It certainly surprised me and i loved every moment. I didn't know what to do with life after this one ended.</p>

<li><b>Lie To Me</b></li>
<p>Love psychology, body language, mind hacks and all that? What are you waiting for? This show is all about that! It's a perfect 10.</p>

<li><b>Black Mirror</b></li>
<p>This one is up here because <em>I LOVE TECHNOLOGY.</em> It's also mixed with mystery and drama... Yes please!</p>

<li><b>House Of Cards</b></li>
<p>I usually don't do politics but this show converted me. I love, love, love the drama.</p>

<li><b>The Mentalist</b></li>
<p>When this show ended.. no other show could live up to it for a good 4 months. Definitly one of my top 3 shows. It's a perfect mix of cop/ criminal action and psychology.</p>

<li><b>Criminal Minds</b></li>
<p>I just love me some dark criminal activity! It's my number 1 go to show for that. (Number 2: Law & Order: SVU because gone are the days of CSI New York)</p>


</ul>

<h2>Honourable mentions</h2>
<p>These shows i also love and would easily recommend:</p>
<li><b>How To Get Away With Murder</b></li><p>Crime.. Mystery.. Law.. It's my kinda show.</p>
<li><b>Utopia</b></li><p>This show offers a pop of colour like no other. My favourite line was "Where is Jessica Hyde?" It's also got a really funny funky soundtrack that reminds me of farts</p>
<li><b>The Night Of</b></li><p>Introduced to me by my Brother.. This show totally depicts injustice. Or justice. We don't quite know yet.</p>
<li><b>Peaky Blinders</b></li><p>This is a show that kept me up well into the mornings. I didn't think i'd like it so much but it kicks ass.</p>
<li><b>The Appentice, Dragons Den (UK) & Shark Tank (Cheating but allow me &#9787;)</b></li><p>Gotta make that moneyyy! It's awesome to see the ideas people come up with. Plus... Drama gallore.</p>
<li>I<b>ncorporated</b></li><p>If you love technology... This show is a MUST WATCH. It's packed with it. Good jaw-dropping tech of the future.</p>
<li><b>The Returned</b></li><p>People coming back from the dead... the mystery behind it all? Yes please!</p>
<li><b>Vikings</b></li><p>Last but not least! It's the version of Game Of Thrones that actually makes sense people.</p>
